This Project uses deep Learning to classify whether a patient is suffering from pneumonia or not based on their chest x-ray images.






## Installation

We need to install some of the python3 libraries in order to run the code seamlessly.

```bash
pip install tensorflow
pip install keras
pip install glob2
pip install scipy
```
    
## Testing

To test this project, clone the repository on your machine and download the dataset from the link given here,
[Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/paultimothymooney/chest-xray-pneumonia).
Copy the chest-xray folder in the repository for proper working of the code.

Open the test.py file and give the path of the x-ray image you want to classify.

Run the code to see the desired output.
